WSO2 WSF/Perl version 1.00
=====================

This module provide the Perl interface to WSO2 WSF/C which is a Web services
framework written in C to support WS-* functionality.

In order to compile this module you have to have WSO2 WSF/C installed on your
computer.  You can get it from here [1] 
Note: The current release of WSO2 WSF/C (1.1.0) have some linking problems
in it's modules.  These modules have not linked the engine so you'll get an
undefined symbol from perl.  You could overcome this either by linking the
engine yourself or get the fixed package [2].
