Details of the latest version can be found on the WSO2 WSF/Perl project page
under http://wso2.org/projects/wsf/perl


Installation
------------

Before installing WSF/Perl you should install WSF/C which is available from
http://wso2.org/projects/wsf/c.  If you install WSF/C to the standard location
(which is /opt/wso2/wsf_c) you can proceed with the following commands to get
WSF/Perl installed.  If you have installd WSF/C to a non standard folder
setting WSFC_HOME environment variable will allow the WSF/Perl installer to
find the correct headers and libraries and install itself.

Also note that WSF/Perl depends on Error.pm module so you need to install that
before installing WSF/Perl.

You can install Error module from CPAN, issue the following command,

$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Error'

Then proceed to install WSF/Perl,

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ sudo make install

After installing WSF/Perl you could run samples in the samples folder.  You
need to have the WSF/C lib folder in your library path.  If you don't have it
you could set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH before runnig the
samples.

$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path to WSF/c>/lib
